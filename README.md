# SPC-UQ: A Post-hoc, Efficient, and Unified Uncertainty Quantification Framework

This repository provides the implementation and evaluation of **SPC-UQ** (Split-Point Consistency for Uncertainty Quantification), a post-hoc, single-forward-pass UQ framework designed to quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty across diverse deep learning tasks.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- **Post-hoc**: Works with pretrained models without architectural modification.
- **Unified**: Applicable to both regression and classification tasks.
- **Efficient**: Requires only a single forward pass for UQ inference.
- **Decomposed Uncertainty**: Separates aleatoric and epistemic signals via self-consistency constraints.

---

## 📊 Benchmarks

SPC-UQ is evaluated on the following tasks:

### ✅ Regression
- **Scalar regression**: Standard UCI datasets (e.g., Boston Housing, Energy).
- **High-dimensional multinomial regression**: Custom synthetic or multimodal datasets.

### ✅ Classification
- **Image classification**: CIFAR-10 / CIFAR-100 using CNN backbones.
- **Multimodal classification**: LUMA dataset with vision, audio, and text inputs.

## 🔬 Results Summary

Compared to representative UQ baselines (e.g., MC Dropout, Deep Ensembles, Evidential Models), SPC-UQ achieves the **best trade-off** among:
- **Predictive accuracy**
- **Computational efficiency**
- **General applicability** across tasks and architectures
